An Optimization Approach to the N-Queens Problem

N-Queen problem is a traditional problem of placing n queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In this paper we propose an optimization-based method for finding the solutions of n-queens problem. Moreover, we proposed a statistical estimation method to determine the number of solutions m. The result of this estimation method is close to the true value Even if we found much less than m solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for such an estimation.
